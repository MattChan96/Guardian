						Our gameplays pattern is defined through the game rules, connection
						between player and the game, challenge and overcoming them, plot and
						player's connection with it. Video game gameplay is distinct from
						graphics and audio elements.
						<br /><br />
						When we talk about presenting a game to someone, we can break it
						down into the gameplay and the aesthetics. On gameplay mechanics and
						loops, these are the elements that people are going to judge your
						game on. Regarding the aesthetics of a title, they are what draw
						people to a game in terms of the overall presentation.

			<h2>The Story</h2>
			<p>
				Guardian is a science fiction-themed side-scrolling beat 'em up game
				reminiscent of Kung-Fu Master, where players assume the role of a robot
				through six increasingly difficult fictional planets, each with a boss
				at the end that must be fought before progressing any further as the
				main objective.

				<p>
					The player controls the robot with a four-way joystick and two attack
					buttons to punch and kick. The joystick is not only used for
					crouching, but for jumping as well. <br />
					<br />
					Punches and kicks are performed from either a standing, crouching or
					jumping position. Along the way, there are three types of items that
					appear as flashing crosses: extra energy stock, invincibility and a
					long-range laser weapon. On occasions, a red orb spawns on the ground
					and when picked up, increases the robot's punching power up to three
					times.
